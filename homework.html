<p>Hi There! I will be writing down an easy and fun recipe to make delicious <strong>Mead</strong>!</p>
<p>What is <strong>Mead</strong> you ask? Allow me to explain.</p>
<p>Mead is an ancient drink with roots all the way back to 1700 BCE! It was a popular drink in Irish and Scandinavian culture, and is often described as <em>Melomel</em>, or Fruit wine!</p>
<p>The main ingredient in Mead is Honey.  Honey has sugar, and in order to ferment, yeast needs sugars to turn our mead to alcohol!</p>
<p>For reference,  here is <a href="https://www.saga.co.uk/magazine/food/drink/guide-to-modern-mead">a picture</a> of what common mead recipes turn into! <strong>Please Note</strong> your mead may look a little different, and that’s ok!</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>3 to 4 pounds of Honey</li>
<li>1 packet of yeast (bread yeast works best)</li>
<li>2 liters of filtered water</li>
<li>A handful of your favorite fruit</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>
<p>Making the mead is quite easy! As you can imagine, they didn’t have many tools back in those days. Luckily, honey we get is much more refined, so we can cut out some of the original steps in mead making.  Follow these easy steps to get your brew started!</p>
<ol>
<li>Add the water and honey to a pot and stir until the honey is dissolved, both honey and water should be room temperature.</li>
<li>Add the honey water mixture to a 1 gallon vassal, preferably a carboy or bucket with a lid. Make sure to have airholes in either!</li>
<li>add your fruit and mix in your yeast additive</li>
</ol>
