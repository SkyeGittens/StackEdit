<p>Hi There! I will be writing down an easy and fun recipe to make delicious <strong>Mead</strong>!</p>
<p>What is <strong>Mead</strong> you ask? Allow me to explain.</p>
<p>Mead is an ancient drink with roots all the way back to 1700 BCE! It was a popular drink in Irish and Scandinavian culture, and is often described as <em>Melomel</em>, or Fruit wine!</p>
<p>The main ingredient in Mead is Honey.  Honey has sugar, and in order to ferment, yeast needs sugars to turn our mead to alcohol!</p>
<p>For reference,</p>
